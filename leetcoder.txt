Project Proposal: Personalized Algorithm Practice PlatformOverviewThis project proposes developing a personalized algorithm practice platform designedto assist students and learners in improving their proficiency in various algorithmictopics. Utilizing existing question sets (such as NeetCode 250), the platform willdynamically recommend algorithm practice problems based on individual userperformance and proficiency, providing tailored learning experiences.Objectives• Automatically assess user proficiency in diHerent algorithm categories based onpast performance.• Recommend practice problems intelligently, guiding users toward topics whereimprovement is most needed.• Enhance learning through AI-driven explanations, leveraging Large LanguageModels (LLMs) to analyze submitted solutions and provide insights.Core Algorithms1. User Proficiency Scoring Algorithmo Computes user proficiency scores by analyzing historical data such ascorrectness rates, completion times, and problem diHiculties.2. Intelligent Recommendation Algorithmo Recommends algorithm problems dynamically by prioritizing topics withlower user proficiency scores, encouraging balanced skill improvement.3. Sorting Algorithmo Used to sort algorithm problems or user statistics by diHiculty,performance metrics, or other relevant criteria.Optional Enhancements:• Collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation for improvedpersonalization.• Visualization of proficiency through interactive graphs.Data StructuresThe project will utilize the following core data structures:• Hash Tables: EHicient storage and retrieval of user proficiency data.• Priority Queues (Heaps): Dynamic prioritization in recommending practiceproblems.• Arrays: Structured storage of the 250 algorithm problems and user performancerecords.• Queues or Stacks: Supporting algorithm visualization tools or managingsequential tasks (optional).• Graphs: Illustrating relationships among algorithm topics (optional).• Linked Lists: Managing user action histories or recent activities (optional).• Binary Search Trees (BST): EHiciently storing and retrieving sorted data such asuser scores or problem diHiculties (optional).This project aligns with the course objectives by demonstrating the practical use ofalgorithms and data structures to solve a real-world, personalized learning challenge.
